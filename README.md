# Exploring Why Civil Resistance Works
In this assignment, you will replicate some of the findings of a well-received book, Why Civil Resistance Works by Erical Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan. The two authors examined whether nonviolent campaigns are more effective than violent campaigns. They found that yes; from a data set containing details of campaigns from 1900 onwards, they found that in general peaceful campaigns are more effective in achieving their aims than violent ones.

To answer the following questions you will use the data that the authors helpfully provide at https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip. The data is in Stata format, which pandas can read without a problem. To understand the data, read the documentation at https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WCRW-Appendix.pdf (in particular, Table WA.7)
